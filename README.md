Make your own Shiny App


The objective of this project is to write my very first Shiny app. 
The ideas are endless, however, I chose to do a simple Shiny app that allows the user to input the number of points within a range 
decided upon by the user and provide as output the average of those randomly chosen points. 

Inputs: \
There are 2 sliders in this Shiny app \
1. The user can select the number of randomly generated points they'd like to take the average 
2. The user can move the slider to identify the range in which the points will be randomly generated - numbers between 1 and 1000

The user should use the slider to move to the number of points they'd like to take the average.
Then the user should move the slider to indicate the range of the value of the points they'd like to use - this limits the values
chosen to take an average of.

Outputs: \
Then an interactive table is updated with the user inputed values from the sliders - the number of points, the range of those points and 
then the average is calucated interactively on the screen.

Enjoy!!
